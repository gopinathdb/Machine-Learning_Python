Refer this for Data Science/ML where the projects goes through a structured skeleton model which will find and suggest the best ML
algorithm for your business use case.Have used pandas,numpy,matplotlib,Scikit-Learn,seaborn libraries,
Hyperparamater tuning,Data Ingestion,Data transformation,Data science,Accuracy,Scores,Feature Importance,Confusion Matrix etc.
The link has below 2 projects comprising of above:
1) Classification Model -- The code is written in python to predict if a person has Heart disease or not using Cleveland medical data from Kaggle.
2) Regression Model     -- The code is written in python to predict pricing of a Bulldozer with Time Series using the input product features with data set from Kaggle.

I have written enough comments on each and every line of the code. Hope this helps for your reference.
